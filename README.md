Insead Venture Evolution Study

The goal of the INSEAD Venture Evolution Study is designed to understand how entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial teams construct their ventures in comparison to their competitors  over time. Your answers will be confidential. They will only be displayed to people outside the research team in aggregation with other people’s responses to mask any one individual’s responses. Importantly, there are no right or wrong answers. We want to understand how you construct your competitive environment, and not someone else. Finally, please answer questions as honestly as possible.
